                       To update your inventory and monitor stock levels, log in to your dashboard and navigate to the
                       "Products" section. Here, you’ll see a list of all products along with their current stock
                       quantities. You can manually adjust stock numbers, add new products, or mark items as out of
                       stock. This section ensures your product listings are accurate and helps prevent overselling or
                       stockouts.

                       customer names, contact information, and their order history, allowing you to manage
                       communication and fulfillment efficiently.
